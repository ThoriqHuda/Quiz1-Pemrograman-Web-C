    <p>Sunan Bonang was one of the Wali Songo,  propagator of Islam in Java in the 14th century AD.
         Sunan Bonang is also known as an artist who preaches using a number of art instruments, including gamelan, as well as literary works.
          Sunan Bonang died on the island of Bawean, at that time the body would be buried in Bawean, but the students in Tuban wanted the body to be buried in Tuban. 
          Then on the night after his death, a number of disciples from Tuban settled into Bawean, and stole the body of Sang Sunan.
           The next day, there was a funeral. Surprisingly, Sunan Bonang's body remains, is considered both in Tuban and in Bawean. 
        Therefore, until now, Sunan's tomb is in two places. One is on Bawean Island, and the other is to the west of the Great Mosque of Tuban.</p>

    <p>Pantai Boom is located in Kutorejo Village, Tuban Regency, or to be precise north of the Tuban Square.
         In the past, Pantai Boom was an important port in the golden era of the Majapahit Kingdom.
         This port became the main route in a crossing, trade, and shipping of the kingdoms of Singasari and Majapahit.
          Now, the beach has been turned into a beautiful tourist spot.
           Entering the gate of Pantai Boom, visitors are treated to beautiful architectural works
            in the form of reliefs that tell about the history of Tuban.</p>
